 <p>Hey, My name is Christian Ngubana.</p>
 <p>I am an agile software developer and volunteer to different events in tech. I strive to write elegant code as usually the result of careful analysis of the problem and finding algorithm and design which simplifies the code greatly while constantly seeking to understand what companies and their clients need are,
 so they can get stuff done.</p>
 <p>I have worked in tech roles for the last 2 years and have over 10,000 hours of experience â€‹solving problems using technology. Above all, It's the problem solving I enjoy the most.</p>

 <p>I Enjoy learning new things, new technologies and working within a great team of other like-minded people that loves what they do, accumulating ideas and tackling the problem together.
    This is my <a href='blog'>technical blog</a>. It is focused on all things about software development and technologies in general.</p>

 <p>I live in Cape Town, South Africa with my family. From being a developer I love being at a gym, I am also a piano player and singer.
 I am passionate about finance and technology, more importantly make the world a better place for everyone.</p>
