 <p>Hey, My name is Christian Ngubana.</p>
 <p>I am an agile software developer and volunteer to different events in tech, I believe to change the world for the better by driving innovation in high performance with technologies</p>
 <p>For the past few years I have gained an extensive experience developing software, and have worked within a highly competitive team of amazing people, pushing the extra mile to archieve unthinkable results.</p>

 <p>I enjoy problem-solving while constantly working hard to understand what the company needs are so that they can get stuff done with the passion and the desire to deliver more than expected.
    I love sharing what I learn with the world, the following is my <a href='blog'>technical blog</a>. It is focused on all things about software development and technologies in general.</p>
